![Hello World, Meet Lilypad]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/hello-world-meet-lilypad.jpg)

For the past eight years I’ve been working as a marketer helping literally hundreds of small to medium sized business owners sell their products and services to their customers.

Using the same techniques I've pitched myself and my skills to potential employers as a business investment instead of a job applicant. I’ve had remarkable success and in 7 years [I've never been without work for more than 30 days](/the-30-day-job-hunt).

Since December 2016 I’ve been helping others achieve the same results and it’s been the most emotionally rewarding work I’ve ever done.

I nearly jumped out of my chair when a cover letter and resume I wrote lead to a [$180,000/yr job offer](https://www.evernote.com/l/ADh9rlEnNsRLQa8c70oBg_fA4KU3yPLz9Po), and I was on cloud 9 when a client-turned-friend I met on reddit finally started getting callbacks for a graphic design career that would mark the end of years of temporary office staffing positions.

## If you're struggling to find work, I can help.
